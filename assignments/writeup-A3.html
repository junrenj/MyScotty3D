Explanation of what it is and how you made it:I pieced together several elements to create this scene: the starry sky scatters like diamonds across a mirror-like water surface, and a campfire burns brightly. On the lonely island, the sound of a guitar draws the attention of the only listener on the seaâ€”a whale. The scene is at media\js3d\A3-FinalRender.js3d.
